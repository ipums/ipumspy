# Contributing
Thank you for considering improving this project! By participating, you
agree to abide by the [code of conduct](https://github.com/ipums/ipumspy/blob/master/CONDUCT.md).

## Issues (Reporting a problem or suggestion)
If you've experience a problem with the package, or have a suggestion for it, 
please post it on the [issues tab](https://github.com/ipums/ipumspy/issues).
This space is meant for questions directly related to the python package, so questions
related to your specific extract may be better answered via email to ipums@umn.edu
(but don't worry about making a mistake, we know it is tough to tell the difference). 

Since our extracts are such large files, posting minimal reproducible examples
may be difficult. Therefore, it will be most helpful if you can provide as 
much detail about your problem as possible including the code and error message,
the project the extract is from, the variables you have selected, file type, etc. 
We'll do our best to answer your question.
