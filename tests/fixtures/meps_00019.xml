  <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, DUID reports the identifier assigned by MEPS to the person's Dwelling Unit (DU), sampled for MEPS data collection. DUID is a random ID number assigned after the DU was sampled for MEPS and does not change once assigned. The MEPS sample is a subset of the households that participated in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). 

DU definitions are generally consistent with NHIS definitions of households. For example, the 2018 NHIS Survey Description document describes households as "occupied housing units" (p. 10) that exclude "long-term care institutions (for example, nursing homes for the elderly, hospitals for the chronically ill or physically or intellectually disabled, and wards for abused or neglected children), correctional facilities (for example, prisons or jails, juvenile detention centers, and halfway houses)." (p. 8). Additionally, "unless one other family member is a civilian eligible for the survey (for example, a child whose parents are both active-duty military)" (p. 8), housing units occupied by active-duty Armed Forces personnel are also excluded from the survey. 

From 1996-2017, DUID is unique within panel, but must be combined with PANEL to be unique across panels. Starting in 2018, DUID begins with the 2-digit variable PANEL, making DUID unique across panels. DUID can be combined with PID to uniquely identify each person within the Dwelling Unit. Please see the user note for more information on the relationship between Dwelling Units, families, Reporting Units, and persons.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, MEPSID is a variable that uniquely identifies respondents across MEPS panels. It is created by combining PANEL, DUID, and PID. IPUMS MEPS staff create MEPSID for the 1996-2017 samples to provide a single, universal linking key for MEPS persons. Beginning in 2018, AHRQ modified the identifiers DUID and DUPERSID (which combines DUID with PID) on the original MEPS data files to append information about PANEL to the first two columns. This update makes DUPERSID identical to MEPSID in the IPUMS MEPS extract system for 2018-forward.

In earlier versions of IPUMS MEPS, IPUMS MEPS staff created a slightly different version of MEPSID, equivalent to combining DUID, PID, and PANEL. This version has been renamed to MEPSID2 and is only available for 1996-2017.]]></txt>

MEPS began in 1996 with Panel number 1 and the panel number for persons entering the MEPS in each subsequent year increases by 1, so that 1997 had Panels 1 (the panel that entered in 1996, in their second year in 1997) and 2 (the panel newly entering MEPS in 1997), 1998 had Panels 2 and 3, 1999 had Panels 3 and 4, and so on. PANEL can be combined with DUID and PID to uniquely identify individuals across panels. IPUMS MEPS offers the constructed variable MEPSID that is equal to the concatenated values of DUID, PID, and PANEL.

  <txt><![CDATA[STRATANN is an IPUMS MEPS-constructed variable based on the annual variance estimation strata variable in the public use files. STRATANN represents the impact of sample design stratification on estimates of variance and standard errors. IPUMS staff generate STRATANN by concatenating YEAR and the original AHRQ-provided variance estimation strata variable, VARSTR. It is appropriate to use STRATANN to generate annual estimates for all years. For pooled analyses including years before and after 2002 or before and after 2019, analysts should instead use the pooled variance sampling strata variable, STRATAPLD. For analyses limited to the years 2002-2018 or 2019-forward, STRATANN is suitable for use in annual and pooled analyses. 

From 1996-2001, values of STRATANN were statistically independent from year to year. Between 2002-2018 and for 2019-forward, values of STRATANN are constant within sample design period. For analysis, researchers need to use STRATANN in conjunction with PSUANN to account for stratification and clustering when computing variance estimates with MEPS data using a Taylor-series Linearization approach.

For analysis, researchers need to use PSUPLD in conjunction with STRATAPLD to account for stratification and clustering when computing variance estimates with IPUMS MEPS data. 
&nbsp;PSUPLD should be used when analysts wish to pool together (aka combine) more than one year of MEPS annual data including any years before 2002 or after 2018. In most years, MEPS samples are not completely independent from one another, both because each panel is in the MEPS for two consecutive years and because households are sampled from the same geographic areas in multiple years. However, because MEPS is designed to be nationally representative in every year, multiple sample years can still be pooled.

  <txt><![CDATA[PERWEIGHT is an IPUMS MEPS-constructed variable based on the Final Person Weight in the original MEPS annual full-year consolidated files.  This weight should be used for many cross-sectional analyses at the person level, particularly with variables for which information was collected about all family members. PERWEIGHT represents the inverse probability of selection into the sample, adjusted for non-response with post-stratification adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals. For each year, the sum of these weights is equal to that year's civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population. 

There are instances, however, when the researcher should use a different person-level weight, particularly when analyzing variables from the Self-Administered Questionnaire or the Diabetes Care Survey, or when conducting longitudinal analyses with the MEPS data. For example, researchers analyzing variables from the Self-Administered Questionnaire from 2000 forward should use SAQWEIGHT rather than PERWEIGHT. 

Users should review the documentation for extracted variables--most notably the "Weights" section toward the top of each variable description--to ascertain which weight is the appropriate choice for a given survey year.]]></txt>

For each year, the sum of these weights is equal to that year's civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population aged 18 and older. SAQWEIGHT adjusts for SAQ non-response.

In 2000, SAQWEIGHT also includes weighting information for children under the age of 18 whose parent or guardian completed the Parent Administered Questionnaire (PAQ). For 2000 only, the sum of SAQWEIGHT is equal to the full civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population. SAQWEIGHT does differ from PERWEIGHT in 2000 because the poststratification age group of 15-19 was partitioned into two groups, 15-17 and 18-19, for SAQWEIGHT to account for the target populations of the SAQ and PAQ.

Users should review the documentation for extracted variables, most notably the "Weights" section toward the top of each variable description, to ascertain which weight is the appropriate choice for a given survey year.

Collection of information on SEX in MEPS&nbsp;Data on the sex of each reporting unit (RU) member was determined during the NHIS interview, and was then verified, and, if necessary, corrected during each MEPS interview.

If the respondent was a new RU member or their sex was not ascertained in the NHIS interview, MEPS initially used the first name of the respondent to assign their sex. If the first name gave no clear indication of sex, the reported family relationships were used to assign sex. If the sex of the respondent was still unclear, sex was randomly assigned. 

The NHIS method of ascertaining the sex of the respondent, which primarily informs the MEPS version of SEX, is similar to the MEPS method. First, sex of the respondent was inferred from the individual's first name or family relationships. If the sex of the respondent was unclear, the interviewer was instructed to explicitly ask the person's sex. Beginning in 1998, interviewers were told to "enter your best guess" when the respondent either did not know or refused to answer the direct question that was asked about the person's sex.]]></txt>

  <labl>Dwelling unit ID, round record</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, DUIDRD reports the identifier assigned by MEPS to the person's Dwelling Unit (DU), sampled for MEPS data collection. DUIDRD is a random ID number assigned after the DU was sampled for MEPS and does not change once assigned. The MEPS sample  is a subset of households that participated in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). 

DU definitions are generally consistent with NHIS definitions of households. For example, the 2018 NHIS Survey Description document describes households as "occupied housing units" (p. 10) that exclude "long-term care institutions (for example, nursing homes for the elderly, hospitals for the chronically ill or physically or intellectually disabled, and wards for abused or neglected children), correctional facilities (for example, prisons or jails, juvenile detention centers, and halfway houses)." (p. 8). Additionally, "unless one other family member is a civilian eligible for the survey (for example, a child whose parents are both active-duty military)" (p. 8), housing units occupied by active-duty Armed Forces personnel are also excluded from the survey.

From 1996-2017, DUIDRD is unique within panel, but must be combined with PANELRD to be unique across panels. Starting in 2018, DUIDRD begins with the 2-digit variable PANEL, making DUID unique across panels. DUIDRD can be combined with PIDRD to uniquely identify each person within the Dwelling Unit.

PANELRD can be combined with DUIDRD and PIDRD to uniquely identify individuals across panels on round records. IPUMS MEPS offers the constructed variable MEPSIDRD that is equal to the concatenated values of DUIDRD, PIDRD, and PANELRD.

  <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, MEPSIDRD is a variable that uniquely identifies respondents across MEPS panels. It is created by combining PANELRD, DUIDRD, and PIDRD. IPUMS MEPS staff create MEPSID for the 1996-2017 samples to provide a single, universal linking key for MEPS persons. Beginning in 2018, AHRQ modified the identifiers DUIDRD and DUPERSIDRD (which combines DUIDRD with PIDRD) on the original MEPS data files to append information about PANELRD to the first two columns. This update makes DUPERSIDRD identical to MEPSIDRD in the IPUMS MEPS extract system for 2018-forward.

In earlier versions of IPUMS MEPS, IPUMS MEPS staff created a slightly different version of MEPSIDRD, equivalent to combining DUIDRD, PIDRD, and PANELRD. This version has been renamed to MEPSID2RD and is only available for 1996-2017.]]></txt>
