  <txt><![CDATA[RECTYPE is an IPUMS MEPS-constructed variable that allows users to discriminate between the different record types in the data. For non-vacant households, each household record is followed by one or more person records. Data at the household level pertain to each person in the household.

Round level records indicate information that is collected during one or more of the five interview rounds that each respondent participates in.

Event, medication-round, and medication-round fill records indicate information that is collected for a specific medical event. Condition level records indicate information that is collected about a specific medical condition. Please see our  overview of the event, medical conditions, and prescribed medicines variables, how those variables are offered through IPUMS MEPS, and general considerations to keep in mind when conducting analyses using these variables.

Event-medication-round link records indicate information that can be used to link event records to medication-round and medication-round fill records. Condition-event link records indicate information that can be used to link condition records to event, medication-round, and medication-round fill records.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, DUID reports the identifier assigned by MEPS to the person's Dwelling Unit (DU), sampled for MEPS data collection. DUID is a random ID number assigned after the DU was sampled for MEPS and does not change once assigned. The MEPS sample is a subset of the households that participated in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). 

DU definitions are generally consistent with NHIS definitions of households. For example, the 2018 NHIS Survey Description document describes households as "occupied housing units" (p. 10) that exclude "long-term care institutions (for example, nursing homes for the elderly, hospitals for the chronically ill or physically or intellectually disabled, and wards for abused or neglected children), correctional facilities (for example, prisons or jails, juvenile detention centers, and halfway houses)." (p. 8). Additionally, "unless one other family member is a civilian eligible for the survey (for example, a child whose parents are both active-duty military)" (p. 8), housing units occupied by active-duty Armed Forces personnel are also excluded from the survey. 

From 1996-2017, DUID is unique within panel, but must be combined with PANEL to be unique across panels. Starting in 2018, DUID begins with the 2-digit variable PANEL, making DUID unique across panels. DUID can be combined with PID to uniquely identify each person within the Dwelling Unit. Please see the user note for more information on the relationship between Dwelling Units, families, Reporting Units, and persons.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, MEPSID is a variable that uniquely identifies respondents across MEPS panels. It is created by combining PANEL, DUID, and PID. IPUMS MEPS staff create MEPSID for the 1996-2017 samples to provide a single, universal linking key for MEPS persons. Beginning in 2018, AHRQ modified the identifiers DUID and DUPERSID (which combines DUID with PID) on the original MEPS data files to append information about PANEL to the first two columns. This update makes DUPERSID identical to MEPSID in the IPUMS MEPS extract system for 2018-forward.

In earlier versions of IPUMS MEPS, IPUMS MEPS staff created a slightly different version of MEPSID, equivalent to combining DUID, PID, and PANEL. This version has been renamed to MEPSID2 and is only available for 1996-2017.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, PANEL reports the number of the panel of which the person was a member. MEPS began in 1996 with Panel number 1 and the panel number for persons entering the MEPS in each subsequent year increases by 1, so that 1997 had Panels 1 (the panel that entered in 1996, in their second year in 1997) and 2 (the panel newly entering MEPS in 1997), 1998 had Panels 2 and 3, 1999 had Panels 3 and 4, and so on. PANEL can be combined with DUID and PID to uniquely identify individuals across panels. IPUMS MEPS offers the constructed variable MEPSID that is equal to the concatenated values of DUID, PID, and PANEL.

  <txt><![CDATA[STRATANN is an IPUMS MEPS-constructed variable based on the annual variance estimation strata variable in the public use files. STRATANN represents the impact of sample design stratification on estimates of variance and standard errors. IPUMS staff generate STRATANN by concatenating YEAR and the original AHRQ-provided variance estimation strata variable, VARSTR. It is appropriate to use STRATANN to generate annual estimates for all years. For pooled analyses including years before and after 2002 or before and after 2019, analysts should instead use the pooled variance sampling strata variable, STRATAPLD. For analyses limited to the years 2002-2018 or 2019-forward, STRATANN is suitable for use in annual and pooled analyses. 

From 1996-2001, values of STRATANN were statistically independent from year to year. Between 2002-2018 and for 2019-forward, values of STRATANN are constant within sample design period. For analysis, researchers need to use STRATANN in conjunction with PSUANN to account for stratification and clustering when computing variance estimates with MEPS data using a Taylor-series Linearization approach.

  <txt><![CDATA[PSUPLD is the pooled variance primary sampling unit variable that represents the impact of the sample design clustering on the estimates of variance and standard errors. It is appropriate to use PSUPLD instead of the annual primary sampling unit (PSUANN) if the years included in a pooled analysis include survey years 1996-2001 or 2019-forward. When pooling data from only 2002-2018, it is appropriate to use the variable PSUANN, the annual stratum variable for each survey year.

For analysis, researchers need to use PSUPLD in conjunction with STRATAPLD to account for stratification and clustering when computing variance estimates with IPUMS MEPS data. 
&nbsp;PSUPLD should be used when analysts wish to pool together (aka combine) more than one year of MEPS annual data including any years before 2002 or after 2018. In most years, MEPS samples are not completely independent from one another, both because each panel is in the MEPS for two consecutive years and because households are sampled from the same geographic areas in multiple years. However, because MEPS is designed to be nationally representative in every year, multiple sample years can still be pooled. The use of PSUPLD and STRAPLD is necessary to obtain appropriate standard errors by specifying a common variance structure.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[STRATAPLD is the pooled variance sampling strata variable that represents the impact of the sample design stratification on the estimates of variance and standard errors. It is appropriate to use STRATAPLD instead of the annual strata variable (STRATANN) if the years included in a pooled analysis include survey years 1996-2001 or 2019-forward. For pooling data from only 2002-2018, it is appropriate to use the variable STRATANN. 

For analysis, researchers need to use STRATAPLD in conjunction with PSUPLD to account for stratification and clustering when computing variance estimates with IPUMS MEPS data.
&nbsp;STRATAPLD should be used when users wish to pool together (aka combine) more than one year of MEPS annual data including any years before 2002 or after 2018. In most years, MEPS samples are not completely independent from one another, both because each panel is in the MEPS for two consecutive years and because households are sampled from the same geographic areas in multiple years. However, because MEPS is designed to be nationally representative in every year, multiple sample years can still be pooled. The use of STRATAPLD and PSUPLD is necessary to obtain appropriate standard errors by specifying a common variance structure.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[PERWEIGHT is an IPUMS MEPS-constructed variable based on the Final Person Weight in the original MEPS annual full-year consolidated files.  This weight should be used for many cross-sectional analyses at the person level, particularly with variables for which information was collected about all family members. PERWEIGHT represents the inverse probability of selection into the sample, adjusted for non-response with post-stratification adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals. For each year, the sum of these weights is equal to that year's civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population. 

There are instances, however, when the researcher should use a different person-level weight, particularly when analyzing variables from the Self-Administered Questionnaire or the Diabetes Care Survey, or when conducting longitudinal analyses with the MEPS data. For example, researchers analyzing variables from the Self-Administered Questionnaire from 2000 forward should use SAQWEIGHT rather than PERWEIGHT.

For each year, the sum of these weights is equal to that year's civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population aged 18 and older. SAQWEIGHT adjusts for SAQ non-response.

In 2000, SAQWEIGHT also includes weighting information for children under the age of 18 whose parent or guardian completed the Parent Administered Questionnaire (PAQ). For 2000 only, the sum of SAQWEIGHT is equal to the full civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population. SAQWEIGHT does differ from PERWEIGHT in 2000 because the poststratification age group of 15-19 was partitioned into two groups, 15-17 and 18-19, for SAQWEIGHT to account for the target populations of the SAQ and PAQ.

Collection of information on SEX in MEPS&nbsp;Data on the sex of each reporting unit (RU) member was determined during the NHIS interview, and was then verified, and, if necessary, corrected during each MEPS interview.

If the respondent was a new RU member or their sex was not ascertained in the NHIS interview, MEPS initially used the first name of the respondent to assign their sex. If the first name gave no clear indication of sex, the reported family relationships were used to assign sex. If the sex of the respondent was still unclear, sex was randomly assigned. 

The NHIS method of ascertaining the sex of the respondent, which primarily informs the MEPS version of SEX, is similar to the MEPS method. First, sex of the respondent was inferred from the individual's first name or family relationships. If the sex of the respondent was unclear, the interviewer was instructed to explicitly ask the person's sex. Beginning in 1998, interviewers were told to "enter your best guess" when the respondent either did not know or refused to answer the direct question that was asked about the person's sex.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[For all medication-round records, DUIDM reports the identifier assigned by MEPS to the person's Dwelling Unit (DU), sampled for MEPS data collection. DUIDM is a random ID number assigned after the DU was sampled for MEPS and does not change once assigned. The MEPS sample is a subset of households that participated in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). 

DU definitions are generally consistent with NHIS definitions of households. For example, the 2018 NHIS Survey Description document describes households as "occupied housing units" (p. 10) that exclude "long-term care institutions (for example, nursing homes for the elderly, hospitals for the chronically ill or physically or intellectually disabled, and wards for abused or neglected children), correctional facilities (for example, prisons or jails, juvenile detention centers, and halfway houses)." (p. 8). Additionally, "unless one other family member is a civilian eligible for the survey (for example, a child whose parents are both active-duty military)" (p. 8), housing units occupied by active-duty Armed Forces personnel are also excluded from the survey.

From 1996-2017, DUIDM is unique within panel, but must be combined with PANELM to be unique across panels. Starting in 2018, DUIDM begins with the 2-digit variable PANELM, making DUIDM unique across panels. DUIDM can be combined with PIDM to uniquely identify each person within the Dwelling Unit.

PANELM can be combined with DUIDM and PIDM to uniquely identify individuals across panels on medication-round records. IPUMS MEPS offers the constructed variable MEPSIDM that is equal to the concatenated values of PANELM, DUIDM, and PIDM.

  <labl>Medication-round record identifier (AHRQ generated)</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[For all medication-round records, LINKIDM is an AHRQ-generated identifier that uniquely identifies medication-round records. LINKIDM is created by combining DUPERSIDM with a numeric value that is the same for each fill of a medication within a given round. LINKIDM differs for the same medication across rounds (see MEPSDRUGID for a unique drug identifier across rounds). From 1996-2017, LINKIDM uniquely identifies medication-round records within a panel. To uniquely identify records across all MEPS panels, please see MEPSLINKIDM. Beginning in 2018, LINKIDM uniquely identifies medication-round records across panels due to changes in the construction of DUPERSIDM to add PANELM to the first two digits of the DUPERSIDM identifier and the addition of a 2-digit event type number.

Event-Medication-Round Record Linking
The event, medication-round, and medication-round fill records can be joined together by using the event-medication-round link records. LINKIDM is on the medication-round record and is the same as LINKIDK on the event-medication-round link record and LINKIDF on the medication-round fill record. The event-medication-round link records (K rectype) and medication-round fill records (F rectype) can be linked to the medication-round records (M rectype) using LINKIDK, LINKIDF, and LINKIDM, respectively. However, due to changes in how LINKIDM is constructed over time, IPUMS MEPS recommends using MEPSLINKIDK, MEPSLINKIDM, and MEPSLINKIDF to join the event-medication-round link, medication-round, and medication-round fill records.

See our user note for more details on how to join the different record types and an overview of the event, medical conditions, and prescribed medicines variables, how those variables are offered through IPUMS MEPS, and general considerations to keep in mind when conducting analyses using these variables.]]></txt>

  <labl>Medication-round record identifier (IPUMS generated)</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[For all medication-round records, MEPSLINKIDM uniquely identifies medication-round records across MEPS panels. MEPSLINKIDM is created for 1996-2017 by combining PANELM, LINKIDM, and a 2-digit event type number ("03" for prescribed medicines, "02" for other medical expenses, and "01" for all other event types). IPUMS MEPS staff create MEPSLINKIDM to provide a single, universal linking key for linking across MEPS event and medication-round records.

Beginning in 2018, AHRQ modified the identifiers DUIDM and DUPERSIDM (which combines DUIDM with PIDM) on the original MEPS data files to append information about PANELM to the first two columns. AHRQ also added a 2-digit event type number beginning in 2018. MEPSLINKIDM is the same as LINKIDM for 2018 forward.

Event-Medication-Round Record Linking&nbsp;The event, medication-round, and medication-round fill records can be joined together by using the event-medication-round link records. MEPSLINKIDM is on the medication-round record and is the same as MEPSLINKIDK on the event-medication-round link record and MEPSLINKIDF on the medication-round fill record.Condition-Event Record Linking&nbsp;The medication-round and condition records can be joined together by using the condition-event link records.

  <labl>Dwelling unit ID, round record</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, DUIDRD reports the identifier assigned by MEPS to the person's Dwelling Unit (DU), sampled for MEPS data collection. DUIDRD is a random ID number assigned after the DU was sampled for MEPS and does not change once assigned. The MEPS sample  is a subset of households that participated in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). 

DU definitions are generally consistent with NHIS definitions of households. For example, the 2018 NHIS Survey Description document describes households as "occupied housing units" (p. 10) that exclude "long-term care institutions (for example, nursing homes for the elderly, hospitals for the chronically ill or physically or intellectually disabled, and wards for abused or neglected children), correctional facilities (for example, prisons or jails, juvenile detention centers, and halfway houses)." (p. 8). Additionally, "unless one other family member is a civilian eligible for the survey (for example, a child whose parents are both active-duty military)" (p. 8), housing units occupied by active-duty Armed Forces personnel are also excluded from the survey.

From 1996-2017, DUIDRD is unique within panel, but must be combined with PANELRD to be unique across panels. Starting in 2018, DUIDRD begins with the 2-digit variable PANEL, making DUID unique across panels. DUIDRD can be combined with PIDRD to uniquely identify each person within the Dwelling Unit.

PANELRD can be combined with DUIDRD and PIDRD to uniquely identify individuals across panels on round records. IPUMS MEPS offers the constructed variable MEPSIDRD that is equal to the concatenated values of DUIDRD, PIDRD, and PANELRD.

  <txt><![CDATA[For all medication-round fills, DUIDF reports the identifier assigned by MEPS to the person's Dwelling Unit (DU), sampled for MEPS data collection. DUIDF is a random ID number assigned after the DU was sampled for MEPS and does not change once assigned. The MEPS sample  is a subset of households that participated in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). 

DU definitions are generally consistent with NHIS definitions of households. For example, the 2018 NHIS Survey Description document describes households as "occupied housing units" (p. 10) that exclude "long-term care institutions (for example, nursing homes for the elderly, hospitals for the chronically ill or physically or intellectually disabled, and wards for abused or neglected children), correctional facilities (for example, prisons or jails, juvenile detention centers, and halfway houses)." (p. 8). Additionally, "unless one other family member is a civilian eligible for the survey (for example, a child whose parents are both active-duty military)" (p. 8), housing units occupied by active-duty Armed Forces personnel are also excluded from the survey.

From 1996-2017, DUIDF is unique within panel, but must be combined with PANELF to be unique across panels. Starting in 2018, DUIDF begins with the 2-digit variable PANELF, making DUIDF unique across panels. DUIDF can be combined with PIDF to uniquely identify each person within the Dwelling Unit. Please see the user note for more information on the relationship between Dwelling Units, families, Reporting Units, and persons.]]></txt>

MEPS began in 1996 with Panel number 1 and the panel number for persons entering the MEPS in each subsequent year increases by 1, so that 1997 had Panels 1 (the panel that entered in 1996, in their second year in 1997) and 2 (the panel newly entering MEPS in 1997), 1998 had Panels 2 and 3, 1999 had Panels 3 and 4, and so on. PANELF can be combined with DUIDF and PIDF to uniquely identify individuals across panels on the medication-round fill records. IPUMS MEPS offers the constructed variable MEPSIDF that is equal to the concatenated values of PANELF, DUIDF, and PIDF. Beginning in 2018, DUIDF begins with PANELF and so concatenating PANELF with DUIDF and PIDF is no longer necessary.

  <labl>Multum medicine name, imputed</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[For all medication-round fills, except diabetic equipment and supplies (see RXNAME) and drugs determined to be a confidentiality risk, RXDRGNAM reports the generic name most commonly used by prescribing physicians for the medication. The drug classification system used to assign RXDRGNAM has remained consistent over time, making it well-suited for trend analyses or pooling years or panels together. RXDRGNAM is assigned using the Multum Lexicon database (for more information about the Multum Lexicon database, see the following section). See also RXNAME and RXNDC for additional information about prescribed medication-round fill attributes. 

A drug can pose a confidentiality risk for several reasons. Examples include orphan drugs, drugs that are estimated to be used by fewer than 200,00 people, or drug names that provide identifying information about the pharmacy or respondent. An orphan drug is a drug that treats a rare disease or condition but has been discontinued because there is little or no economic incentive to continue development or production. See Rare Diseases at the FDA for more information about how these drugs are designated and the effort to financially support their development and production under the Orphan Drug Act. See the codes tab for more detailed information about how these cases are handled in the data. 

RXDRGNAM is on the prescribed medication-round fill record (or "medication-round fill record," see RECTYPE for more details on the different record types in IPUMS MEPS). Variables offered on the medication-round fill record through IPUMS MEPS are derived from the prescribed medicines file provided by AHRQ. Please see our overview of the event, medical conditions, and prescribed medicines variables, including how those variables are offered through IPUMS MEPS, and general considerations to keep in mind when conducting analyses using these variables.

IPUMS MEPS reports the universe for each variable based on a thorough review of the original MEPS documentation. Investigating the data may reveal cases that do not meet the stated universe. Users are encouraged to validate universes for their analyses.

Multum Lexicon Variables

Cerner Multum, Inc. develops the Multum Lexicon database that MEPS uses to classify drugs reported by respondents in the MEPS-HC. Each drug is assigned a Multum drug name (RXDRGNAM), a pregnancy category (PREGCAT), and to one or more therapeutic class, sub-class, and sub-sub-class designations (see MULTC1 for more information about the Multum Lexicon variables). 

Users of the Multum Lexicon variables should cite Multum Lexicon, AHRQ, and IPUMS MEPS as the data sources.]]></txt>
  <codInstr><![CDATA[CodesRXDRGNAM is a 60-character string variable. 

In 2014-onward samples, in the case that a prescription drug name was determined to be a confidentiality risk, the most detailed Multum Lexicon therapeutic classification value available (see MULTC1) replaced RXDRGNAM (Multum drug name). The most detailed classification value available means that if a medication fill has a sub-sub-class value assigned, such as “SSRI antidepressants,” this is the value used for RXDRGNAM in the case that the drug name was determined to be a confidentiality risk. If a medication fill has a sub-class value, such as “antidepressants,” but no sub-sub-class value assigned, then the sub-class value is the value used for RXDRGNAM. If a medication fill has a class value, such as “psychotherapeutic agents,” but no sub-class or sub-sub-class value assigned, then the class value is the value used for RXDRGNAM. 

In 1996-2013 samples, in the case that a prescription drug name was determined to be a confidentiality risk, RXDRGNAM is assigned a value of 8 – “Unknown-not ascertained.”

Additionally, diabetic equipment and supplies (see RXNAME) are also assigned a RXDRGNAM value of 8 – “Unknown-not ascertained” for all years.]]></codInstr>
